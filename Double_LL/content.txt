Double LL
operations:
1. insertion 
2. deletion
3. traversing

head <--> node1<-->node2<-->node3<-->null

class node:
    def __init__(self, data):
        self.data = data
        self.prev = None
        self.next = None

The time complexity of the above operations are as follows:
1. insertion: O(n)
2. deletion: O(n)
3. search: O(n)
